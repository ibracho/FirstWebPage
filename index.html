<p>Hey! My name is <b><i>Isabel Bracho</i></b></p>
<p>I am a <em>Software Development Student</em> I excited to learn computer language and be able to create my own websites</p>
<strong>About me!</strong>
<p>I decided to learn coding thanks to my friends all of them are into C++, python, Java and more.
    I love playing videogames and most of my time I spend it in my computer. I built my own computer from scratch
    and coding feels like building something but in computer language which makes more exciting!
</p>
<mark>I have a lot expectations from this course!</mark>
